This is a file I made to understand Chakra UI.

In order to learn Chakra UI, I follow Net Ninja's crach course on YouTube: https://youtu.be/iXsM6NkEmFc?si=FKriCfKUShjjLyDE

Download the chakra package. Get the ChakraProvider and wrap the application to get access to the components.

Notable components: Container (centers stuff), Box (like a div), Text, Heading.

You can style the components using props of the components: p={30}, bg="red.100", etc.

There is a sx prop that lets you pass an object with styles: sx = {boxStyles}

You can implement flex box layouts with the Flex component. It has attributes like justify, alignItems, 
gap, etc. You can add a spacer tag: <Spacer/>. You can also take advangtage of HStack and VStack. 

If you want to implement a grid layout, you can use SimpleGrid component or, with more flexibility Grid and
GridItem.

You can apply responsive design using breakpoints:
fontSize={{base:'24px', md: '40px', lg: '56px'}} or
color={{base: 'pink', md: 'blue', lg: 'green'}}
